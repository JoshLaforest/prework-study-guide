# Prework Study Guide for Dedicated Students

## Description

This prework study guide was born of an inspiration to help budding students feel supported on their journey. 
The idea was to create a place where students can easily access valuble information to assist with their studies. 
Thus helping to alleviate the stress of juggling multiple sources in an attempt to stay organised.
This project has helped to develop my growing skills as a developer.

This is a simple webpage that merely keeps information organised. 
One can easily browse through the sections covering various topics such as; *HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript*. 

However, it is possible for one to open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), in order to see the Javascript running. 
A list of topics covered in the prework will be shown, as well as a suggestion on what topic to study first.
